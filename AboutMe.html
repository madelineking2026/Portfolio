    <h1> About Me</h1>

    <iframe id="gif-iframe" src="greeting.gif" alt="A gif of the word hello."></iframe>

    <p>Welcome! My name is Madeline King, and I am a student journalist passionate about covering arts and entertainment, politics and data-driven stories. I am currently pursuing a double major in journalism and political science at Northwestern University, as well as the integrated marketing communications certificate.</p>
    <p>I currently serve on the editorial board for The Daily Northwestern as the Arts & Entertainment editor. You can view my portfolio <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/staff_name/madeline-king/"> here. </a></p>
    <p>The article I’m proudest of has to be <a href="https://medilltrialmonitors.substack.com/p/the-impact-of-prison-gerrymandering"> "The impact of prison gerrymandering."</a> Bringing attention to how incarceration can affect political representation — disproportionally harming people of color — was a very important story to tell.</p>
    <p>Outside of journalism, I worked in the district office of Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver, II for the past two summers. My largest project was to compile a history of Bruce R. Watkins Drive, a local roadway. To do so, I read over 500 articles in the archives of The Kansas City Star and The Kansas City Times. This project taught me valuable research skills that serve me well in the journalism field. </p>
    <p>I am also very passionate about Kesem Northwestern, a volunteer organization providing year round support and free summer camps to kids in the Chicagoland area affected by a parent’s cancer.</p>
    <p>In the future, I hope to go to law school and eventually work as a lawyer for a news orgizanition, defending free speech and freedom of the press. </p>
